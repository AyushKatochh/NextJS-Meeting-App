# NextJS Meeting App

## Overview
This is a meeting app implemented using Next.js, a popular React framework. The app includes server-side rendering, file-based routing, nested paths, link between pages, and outputting a list of meetups. It utilizes layout wrappers, axios for data fetching, MongoDB for data storage, and includes head metadata for SEO purposes.
